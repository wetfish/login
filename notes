Include client side library
Trigger login function when necessary
    - Login window appears
Loads login.wetfish.net 
Prompts for username/password or register
If user signs in successfully
    - Redirected to callback url with a token
The callback page records the user's session and their token
The callback page makes a request back to the login server
The login server responds with basic information about the user based on the token

The app and the login server should have some sort of a shared secret/API key for message verification
